# SubredditAnalysis
Project analysing content of social media platform Reddit including sematic similarities and text classification using DistilBERT

Includes scraping of reddit posts using Reddit API, some basic statistics of the posts on reddit, generation of wordclouds and generation of similar subreddits per subreddit. Finally, a paper on reddit post classification was referenced and their experiment recreated using DistilBERT. Text classification was very succesful, leading to possibility of exapning the designed model to more subreddits.
